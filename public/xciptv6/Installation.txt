**To install the panel**

1. Create a new MySQL database on your hosting
2. Create a user that has access to that database
3. Add the details to the db.php file in the includes folder.
4. Navigate your browser to the place you've placed the panel
5. There should be a button to install - if there's an error message it means your database details are not correct
6. That's it - the database will be built and your login username/password will be displayed at the login screen.

**For the APK**

Search for https://yourpanelurl/xciptv/ in the SMALI and replace with your panel URL *8 locations* - the correct URL should be in the XCIPTV app settings tab in your panel.
